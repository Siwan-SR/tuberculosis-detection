# ü§ß Tuberculosis Detection

A neural deep learning model that detects whether a person has Tuberculosis using chest X - rays.

## Data

The data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset

## ü•ß How the model was made

The model was made using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), an excellent machine learning and deep learning library. I used Keras as the model.

## üèóÔ∏è How the notebook is structured

* Explore the data
* Create model
* Log model records
* Train the model
* Load the best model and find its accuracy

## üîç What you will find

* The use of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* Many awesome functions
* Use of the [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/) model
* A Tensorboard which visualizes the model records
* Accuracy of the best model
* Practical example of Tuberculosis detection using X-rays
